# Hi there, I'm Fuky9 ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a pharmacist with a passion for coding. I love sports, nature, hardening in icy water, delicious food and exploring new technologies.

## About Me

I enjoy developing web applications and working with a variety of modern technologies. I've finished Meta Back End Developer Professional Certificate (covering Python, Version Control, Databases and SQL, Django, APIs (DRF)) and the MDN Learn Web Development learning module(covering HTML, CSS and JS). Currently, I am working on the IBM Full Stack Developer Certificate. Developing Web Applications with React course to be more specific. In the near future, I would like to delve deeper into technologies such as Node.js, Express, Flask and DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Microservices, Serverless). I aim to eventually connect health and technology to create meaningful applications with a positive impact. Here are some of the technologies I've been working with recently:
